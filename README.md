# transcendtech
A repository for managing the files and code for Transcend Tech Website.

2. Branching: The repository will include a "develop" branch for ongoing development work, and a "main" branch for the stable, live version of the website.
3. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, using Git to merge changes and resolve conflicts.
4. Issue tracking: The repository will include an issue tracker to help manage bugs and feature requests.
Continuous integration: The repository can be integrated with a continuous integration tool like Travis CI or CircleCI to automate testing and deployment of new website versions.
